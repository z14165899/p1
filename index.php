<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>My name is Chen Zhao from Vancouver of Canada. I previous graduated from University of British Columbia as a Master of Chemical and Biological Enginnering. I now work as a tutor in multiple schools in a nearby city called Richmond and keep learning new knowledge during this teaching process. I am passionate about learning web technologies and computer languages, so I plan to earn a Web Technologies Certificate for myself in order to have opportunities working as a web developer in the future.</p>
